### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PaymentAnalytics.git
   cd PaymentAnalytics
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Preprocess the data:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Analyze the data:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze.py
   ```

3. **Interactive Analysis with Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
     ```

### Data Analysis

The `analyze.py` script and the Jupyter Notebook perform the following analyses:

- **Number of transactions per platform:** Displays the count of transactions for each payment platform.
- **Total amount per currency:** Shows the total amount transacted for each currency.
- **Status distribution:** Illustrates the distribution of transaction statuses (completed, failed, pending).
